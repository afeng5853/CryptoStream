# CryptoStream
## AT&T Entertainment Hackathon Winner for Best Next Generation Advertising Solution

A decentralized platform allowing content creators to automatically receive revenue by claiming their website to a wallet on the Ethereum Network and reward their fans.

Fans will install an extension that will ask the user after watching a video or stream to give a fair amount based on the amount they watched. After donating, they will receive a special token from the content creator which can be redeemed for rewards by the Content Creator.

In order to verify the owner of the websites, content creators will have to change their profile picture to a custom QR code for our backend servers to verify.
